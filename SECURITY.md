# Security Policy

**PLEASE DON'T DISCLOSE SECURITY-RELATED ISSUES PUBLICLY, [SEE BELOW](#reporting-a-vulnerability).**

## Supported Versions

Bug and security fixes are supported only for the latest major version.

Backport of security fixes for older major versions are decided on a
case-by-case basis that takes into account the Laravel framework 
support policy, the currently supported Laravel versions within
the library and the installation on that version.
